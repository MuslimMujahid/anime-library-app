[Music]

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,590



5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,770
hey guys thank you for joining the

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,770



7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,560
livestream as you can see from the title

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,560



9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,830
this video is going to be about

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,830



11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,330
embedding payloads in android apk this

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,330



13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,199
is a video that has been requested

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,199



15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,000
for quite some time and so i'm gonna be

16
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,000



17
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:38,940
showing you that in this particular

18
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,940



19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,879
video so again the whole idea was to do

20
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,879



21
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,739
it manually so that's primarily what I'm

22
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,739



23
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,080
going to be doing so by default I

24
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:46,080



25
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,269
already have downloaded in an apk here

26
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,269



27
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,450
I'm going to be using the Bitcoin wallet

28
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:51,450



29
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,220
to be demonstrating this so I'll be

30
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,220



31
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,649
taking you through the overall process

32
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,649



33
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,570
of doing it so the first thing that

34
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,570



35
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,360
we're going to be doing is generating

36
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,360



37
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:05,220
the payload with MSF venom so no

38
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,220



39
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,500
obfuscation yet so after we regenerate

40
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,500



41
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,440
the payload we're then gonna within a

42
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,440



43
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,680
kinetic compile the payload with apktool

44
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,680



45
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,180
and then we'll also use our our

46
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,180



47
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,530
particular APK of choice and also

48
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,530



49
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,810
decompile it and i'll show you how to

50
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,810



51
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,690
embed the payload or inject the payload

52
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,690



53
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,310
into a particular application or APK

54
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,310



55
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,810
file alright so let us get started here

56
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,810



57
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,700
so the first thing of course we are

58
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,700



59
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,340
going to need to do is we are going to

60
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,340



61
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,410
need to generate our our payload with

62
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,410



63
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,610
MSF venom alright so let's do that right

64
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,610



65
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:40,050
now so I myself venom Peep and that

66
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,050



67
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,539
that's our payload and of course with

68
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,539



69
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,920
metadata there are various modules that

70
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:43,920



71
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:46,770
you can use so for example you can use

72
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,770



73
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,649
the reverse tcp reverse https etc so

74
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,649



75
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,039
river android the temperature and

76
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:53,039



77
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,229
reverse tcp I'll be stopping during the

78
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,229



79
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:57,390
video to answer your questions so yeah

80
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,390



81
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,950
you can just post them right over there

82
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,950



83
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,220
and I'll be answering them so

84
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,220



85
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,179
meterpreter reverse reverse TCP and then

86
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,179



87
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:09,270
of course you can set your L host to

88
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:09,270



89
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:11,610
192.168.1.1 o8 and your airport I'll set

90
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,610



91
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,440
that to just 1 2 3 4 and again you then

92
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,440



93
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,630
you then move on to search or to

94
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,630



95
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,900
actually outputting the file so we'll

96
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,900



97
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,599
just call this a payload dot apk and oh

98
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,599



99
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,970
my I'm on my desktop but anyway I'll

100
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,970



101
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,799
just copy that file there so I will

102
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,799



103
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,049
generate the payload and then we can

104
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,049



105
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,370
then also we'll start decompiling the

106
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,370



107
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,880
payload first I'll show you how to do

108
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,880



109
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,950
that with

110
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,950



111
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,650
pick a tool so that's the first thing

112
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,650



113
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,620
we'll be doing and then we can start we

114
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,620



115
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,570
can actually start decompiling

116
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,570



117
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,580
the the other Android application so

118
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,580



119
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,260
there are many applications that you can

120
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,260



121
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,780
use so yeah I'm gonna be answering the

122
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,780



123
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,640
questions as the video essentially takes

124
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,640



125
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,710
its time during the process apologies if

126
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,710



127
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,630
my machine is a bit slow here I'm using

128
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,630



129
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,670
a virtual machine with very stringent

130
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,670



131
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,430
resources so there we are the payload

132
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,430



133
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,350
has been generated and we can actually

134
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,350



135
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,060
get started now alright so I'm just

136
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,060



137
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,280
going to copy the payload from this

138
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,280



139
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,710
directory into our desktop here and we

140
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,710



141
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,440
move into our desktop now and we have

142
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,440



143
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,510
our apk right over here so - you are

144
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,510



145
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,890
actually decompile an application with

146
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,890



147
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,080
apktool we can I can click an apk tool

148
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,080



149
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,080
here and then of course we decompile

150
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,080



151
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,790
which is denoted by the D command and we

152
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,790



153
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,700
use the F command and then we specify

154
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,700



155
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,740
the application so payload apk that is

156
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,740



157
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,200
if it is in D working

158
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,200



159
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,820
if it is in the working directory so

160
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,820



161
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,300
otherwise you need to specify the

162
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,300



163
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,490
directory of the application so then we

164
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,490



165
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,990
then move on to the output where we want

166
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,990



167
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,900
to output the file so I'm just going to

168
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,900



169
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,250
say root desktop the decompiled

170
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,250



171
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,680
information and I'll just call it

172
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,680



173
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,900
payload into the payload folder and hit

174
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,900



175
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,930
enter and that is going to start ddeok

176
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,930



177
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,840
the decompiling the application alright

178
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,840



179
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,770
so we will then move on and let me turn

180
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,770



181
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,530
on some questions here so the syste

182
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,530



183
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,290
internals have a decompiler sysinternals

184
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,290



185
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,300
is more focused on windows and windows

186
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,300



187
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,070
management I'll be making a video on

188
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,070



189
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,720
that as well this payload only works on

190
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,720



191
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,330
your local network or you can set up

192
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,330



193
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,410
port forwarding that is if you have

194
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,410



195
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:24,390
static IP so that it does work unless if

196
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,390



197
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,610
you have a dynamic IP then if it's going

198
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,610



199
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,650
to keep on changing then you might not

200
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,650



201
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,890
have a persistent session so it's always

202
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,890



203
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,450
good to have a static IP for that

204
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,450



205
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,010
alright so the D compilation is

206
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,010



207
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,720
completed so I'm just gonna list the

208
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,720



209
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,790
files in here and you can see that we

210
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,790



211
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,650
have the payload folder right over here

212
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,650



213
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,610
now the interesting thing that you can

214
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,610



215
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,340
actually do with with

216
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,340



217
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,599
payload so if I switch into the payload

218
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,599



219
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,870
directory here we have the

220
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:49,870



221
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:52,360
androidmanifest.xml we have the apktool

222
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,360



223
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,650
dot yet at the ml file here which are

224
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,650



225
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,900
not working with we working with the

226
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,900



227
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,969
small e folder which is the assembler

228
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,969



229
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,590
which can be considered an assembler for

230
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,590



231
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:01,780
Android so if we go into the small e

232
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,780



233
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,620
folder this is where we will have our

234
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,620



235
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,629
comm Metasploit and the stage directory

236
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,629



237
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,610
all right so if I change into the comm

238
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,610



239
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:11,560
right away and we have the Metasploit

240
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,560



241
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,500
and then you'll find the payload file

242
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,500



243
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,020
within the Metasploit folder and within

244
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,020



245
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,259
the this stage so if I just hit enter

246
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,259



247
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,560
there we are so we have the payload the

248
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,560



249
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,270
payload small D file right over here so

250
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,270



251
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,539
general editing of the payload

252
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,539



253
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,699
application is very very simple so if I

254
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,699



255
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,289
was to just go back into my previous

256
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,289



257
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,849
directories here sorry about that let me

258
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,849



259
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,960
just take you a step back so we can

260
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,960



261
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,000
actually take a look at the Android

262
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,000



263
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,169
manifest so the Android manifest is

264
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,169



265
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,639
where you can essentially edit the

266
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,639



267
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,960
permissions for your payload but of

268
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:40,960



269
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,460
course we'll be looking at that in a

270
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,460



271
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,860
second so if I just browse onto my

272
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,860



273
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,860
desktop here let me just open that up

274
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,860



275
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,349
apologies this is taking a while desktop

276
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,349



277
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:55,810
and are we going to our payload here and

278
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,810



279
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:57,219
Android manifest dot XML and yeah there

280
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,219



281
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,650
we are so we have our permissions in

282
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,650



283
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:01,839
here and what we'll be looking for one

284
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,839



285
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,190
will be decompiling or other application

286
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,190



287
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,409
in which will be embedding the

288
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,409



289
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,120
particular payload is we're looking for

290
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,120



291
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:09,339
the main activity alright now this is

292
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,339



293
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,259
going to be very important but of course

294
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,259



295
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,270
this application has no other activity

296
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,270



297
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,279
so the default one will be the oncreate

298
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,279



299
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,680
for the main activity if you've ever

300
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:17,680



301
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,930
done Android programming all right so

302
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,930



303
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,129
we're looking particularly for these two

304
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,129



305
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,560
lines of code we're looking for the

306
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,560



307
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:25,180
Android intent action main that is the

308
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,180



309
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,949
most important one right over here and

310
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,949



311
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,379
from that you'll get the application

312
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,379



313
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:32,319
source so right over here is where you

314
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,319



315
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,460
can edit your your permissions but these

316
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,460



317
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,639
are going to be important especially

318
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,639



319
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,400
when embedding the Metasploit payload

320
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,400



321
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,099
into your into your other other Android

322
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,099



323
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,779
application so let's get let's actually

324
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,779



325
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,310
get started on that right now so what

326
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,310



327
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:48,659
I'm going to do is I'm just going to

328
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,659



329
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,159
take a step back here and I'll just copy

330
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,159



331
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,259
the application which is the Bitcoin

332
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,259



333
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,120
wallet I believe I'll sorry that is in

334
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,120



335
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:58,150
my downloads folder

336
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,150



337
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,370
my downloads folder like so and that is

338
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,370



339
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,220
in comm I believe what is the

340
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,220



341
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,940
application name not sure it's telling

342
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,940



343
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,770
me what my application name is did I

344
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,770



345
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,030
actually download the application let me

346
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,030



347
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,070
just check

348
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,070



349
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,560
I should have got it right over here

350
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,560



351
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,120
yeah there we are it is the the shell

352
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,120



353
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,340
bat or wallet so let me just copy it

354
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,340



355
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,140
here directly so we can actually speed

356
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,140



357
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,400
this up all right so we can get started

358
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,400



359
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,080
with the D compilation all right so in

360
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,080



361
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,340
here we can start D compiling this so

362
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,340



363
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,530
apktool again APK to be compiled F and

364
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,530



365
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,170
then we specify the application here

366
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,170



367
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,620
sorry this is on my Android yeah sorry

368
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,620



369
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,080
about that

370
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,080



371
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,650
the the application here we output this

372
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,650



373
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,620
I'll just call this desktop and we will

374
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,620



375
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,220
call this the original the original APK

376
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,220



377
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,220
and hit enter

378
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,390



379
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,550
all right let me take a look at the

380
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,550



381
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,580
questions here that we're getting Ryan

382
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,580

no that's that's not a question for me

384
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,250



385
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:07,130
how to get a static IP that will depend

386
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,130



387
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:11,169
on your ISP and how many and what IPS

388
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,169



389
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:15,220

390
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,220



391
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,220
yeah if you say so

392
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,050



393
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:24,139
good hustle how's everyone doing alright

394
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,139



395
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,320
a DD compilation is complete we can

396
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,320



397
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:29,090
actually move on alright so now we need

398
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,090



399
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,580
to go into the original folder here and

400
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,580



401
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,710
this is what we'll be doing most of the

402
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,710



403
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,320
editing so again the first thing you

404
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,320



405
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,770
want to do is you want to actually

406
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,770



407
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,479
create the Metasploit stage folder

408
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,479



409
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,570
within the smally folders also you have

410
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,570



411
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,279
to do there under calm so smally we

412
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,279



413
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,310
enter here so don't go into the forum

414
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,310



415
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,350
directory we hit enter and in here we

416
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,350



417
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,120
need to create the Metasploit so we just

418
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,120



419
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,040
we just create the Metasploit stage

420
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,040



421
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:02,000
folder so m'kay there are Metasploit CD

422
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,000



423
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,279
Metasploit and make directory we'll just

424
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,279



425
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,350
call this stage and that will change our

426
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,350



427
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,150
directory into stage so now what we need

428
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,150



429
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,330
to do is we need to copy that initial

430
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,330



431
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,240
payload from the Metasploit stage folder

432
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,240



433
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,279
into the the small EECOM Metasploit

434
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,279



435
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,810
stage folder as well so that's the first

436
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,810



437
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,160
thing we need to transfer the payload

438
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,160



439
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,890
and then I'll show you how to actually

440
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,890



441
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,589
add that line of code after we do during

442
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,589



443
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,589
the main activity so what I'll be doing

444
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,589



445
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,690
for this video because I have a few

446
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:29,690



447
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,580
minutes left that I can actually live

448
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,580



449
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,830
stream I'll be actually recording

450
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,830



451
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,620
follow-up videos for this showing out to

452
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,620



453
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,470
sign the apks and now to obfuscate them

454
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,470



455
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,540
so let's do that first so what I'm going

456
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,540



457
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,700
to resolve is gonna say coffee root

458
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,700



459
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,339
desktop and we are looking for the

460
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,339



461
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,860
payload so payload what what are the

462
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,860



463
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,000
directories we have in here so failure

464
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,000



465
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,910
there we are

466
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,910



467
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,920
we have the smoly folder and we want to

468
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,920



469
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,160
go into comm Metasploit and we want the

470
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,160



471
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,620
payload the if we actually get the stage

472
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,620



473
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,110
and the payload that's Molly file right

474
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,110



475
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,199
over here and we will copy that again

476
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,199



477
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,699
from that directory

478
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,699



479
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:13,499
rude desktop and we are moving into the

480
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:13,499



481
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:19,389
original so original small e small e

482
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:19,389



483
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:21,009
comm Metasploit stage and enter and we

484
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,009



485
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,459
should have the file in there alright so

486
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,459



487
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:29,109
that is the payload right over here

488
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:29,109



489
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:30,879
before we actually move on exploit will

490
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:30,879



491
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:32,889
this video be accessible after the

492
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:32,889



493
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,689
stream yes it will be

494
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,689



495
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:41,290
that's primarily was making this video

496
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:41,290



497
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:44,230
because it was just Narayan mahoto asks

498
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,230



499
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,559
me what I'm doing and a very obscure way

500
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,559



501
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:52,089
but anyway I'll just I'll just forget

502
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:52,089



503
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:55,540
that ever happened so now that we have

504
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,540



505
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:57,040
the payload dot small e file within the

506
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,040



507
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,230
Metasploit stage folder created under

508
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,230



509
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,169
the array original APK file we can

510
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,169



511
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,119
actually get started with editing with

512
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,119



513
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:05,350
editing the the Android manifest file

514
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:05,350



515
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:07,749
however the first thing as I mentioned

516
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,749



517
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,929
we need to do is we need to look for the

518
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:10,929



519
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:12,669
the main activity that is going to be

520
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,669



521
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:14,799
launched when the application starts off

522
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,799



523
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:16,629
first so what happens is when we start

524
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,629



525
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,639
that the application first for the first

526
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,639



527
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:20,949
time as you do with Android for any of

528
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,949



529
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,899
you have done Android programming the

530
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:22,899



531
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:24,610
main activity is what is started so we

532
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,610



533
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,989
are primarily looking for that so we're

534
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,989



535
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,169
gonna go into original Android manifest

536
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:29,169



537
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:30,549
open with text editor and now this is

538
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,549



539
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:32,139
where the exciting stuff is so you can

540
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,139



541
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:36,519
go ahead and take a look at the minimum

542
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,519



543
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:39,279
SDK requirements and again what we're

544
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:39,279



545
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,769
looking for is the Android intent action

546
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,769



547
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,769
dot main and the activity will be just

548
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,769



549
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:47,559
listed as a as the top right over here

550
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,559



551
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,600
so this these two go under the the

552
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,600



553
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,079
activity alias which is listed as well

554
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,079



555
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,999
over here so we're looking for

556
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,999



557
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,220
de-shelled batch wallet UI wallet wallet

558
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:57,220



559
00:11:54,999 --> 00:12:00,309
activity alright so we're gonna look for

560
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,309



561
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,859
that directory right now so that is de

562
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,859



563
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:04,239
and that is under small e again so small

564
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:04,239



565
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:07,600
e de

566
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:07,600



567
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:09,279
shell batch wallet and we're looking for

568
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,279



569
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,559
the UI so we're going to look for the UI

570
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,559



571
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,999
folder here and we're looking for the

572
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:15,999



573
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:17,709
wallet activity alright so we can hold

574
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:17,709



575
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,880
activity there we are and we can open

576
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:18,880



577
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:21,040
that up with TextEdit

578
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,040



579
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,370
and now we're looking for the oncreate

580
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,370



581
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,560
function all right so the uncrate again

582
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,560



583
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,720
is very important because we are looking

584
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,720



585
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,480
for the land raid OS bundle so we can

586
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,480



587
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,160
add the line right over here now many of

588
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,160



589
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,100
you will be wondering now we like will

590
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,100

593
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,399
the invoke super so this is a we're

594
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,399



595
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,709
going to be invoking a static one and

596
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,709



597
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,829
that again is going to be launching the

598
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,829



599
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:46,540
payload on well during an on create

600
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:46,540



601
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:49,180
function which again is going to utilize

602
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,180



603
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,899
a deal android right over here

604
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,899



605
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,670
alright so now we can actually get

606
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,670



607
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,019
started here so the first thing as i

608
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,019



609
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,290
mentioned we're going to get started

610
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,290



611
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:02,190
with is we need to start copying those

612
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,190



613
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,509
particular files so before we actually

614
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,509



615
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,339
before you actually move ahead with this

616
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,339



617
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:09,550
video let me just explain what's going

618
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,550



619
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,110
on so we are going to be going into the

620
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,110



621
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,029
wallet activity which is going to be

622
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,029



623
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,529
launched during the b1 the application

624
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,529



625
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,639
is launched and so during that

626
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,639



627
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,699
application we're going to use the

628
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,699



629
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,649
oncreate as well here to essentially

630
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,649



631
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,509
load up the payload thoughts mali file

632
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,509



633
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,089
that we actually copied alright so let

634
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:25,089



635
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,319
us actually get started so what i'm

636
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,319



637
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,910
gonna do is let me just go through your

638
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,910



639
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,680
questions or i'll actually go through

640
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,680



641
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,529
them after this so the first thing we're

642
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,529



643
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,120
gonna do is we're going to go to a line

644
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,120



645
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:37,029
we will go right over here we need to

646
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,029



647
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,069
have it below the on cradle android that

648
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,069



649
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:41,620
users utilizes the OS bundle here so

650
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,620



651
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,060
we're gonna say sorry there we are there

652
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,060



653
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,019
there it is so I'm just gonna indent

654
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,019



655
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,689
appropriately so invoke static and again

656
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,689



657
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:52,569
we're going to use a p0 so p0 here in

658
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,569



659
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:54,189
curly braces so p0 and I'll explain what

660
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,189



661
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:56,319
all of this is I'm plan on making a

662
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,319



663
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:58,360
separate video for this because again I

664
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,360



665
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:01,209
am going to be stop confusing people if

666
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,209



667
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,709
I go on with that so invoke static and

668
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,709



669
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,839
then we're gonna use the alcohol which

670
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,839



671
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,750
is the the comm folder so al comm and

672
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,750



673
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,779
then the Metasploit folder Metasploit

674
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,779



675
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,130
and then you have your stage and the OPP

676
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,130



677
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,319
up you have your payload here which

678
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,319



679
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,509
again is in payload you don't need to

680
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:16,509



681
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,850
specify that it is a small e file so you

682
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:18,850



683
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:21,430
can leave the extension so then that is

684
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,430



685
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,670
going to bring us up into the oncreate

686
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,670



687
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,529
function so on on create and then now

688
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,529



689
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,720
we're utilizing land roid again so all

690
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,720



691
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:30,580
Android the content and in the context

692
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,580



693
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,519
so we'll it launch every time

694
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,519



695
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,230
the the wallet activity is started up

696
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,230



697
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,970
which is the main activity when the

698
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,970



699
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,740
application starts up so yeah there we

700
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,740



701
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,240
are so that'll essentially launch any

702
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,240



703
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,880
payload and if you have created the

704
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,880



705
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,440
payload appropriately you set up your

706
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,440



707
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,820
your exploit multi handler and you're

708
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,820



709
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,829
pretty good right over there to get

710
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,829



711
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,640
started so on create and then we're

712
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:51,640



713
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:53,260
using the we're using land right orell

714
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,260



715
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,399
Android whatever your Nepal it for those

716
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,399



717
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:59,110
of you content and then context context

718
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,110



719
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,779
and then we close that up and we use the

720
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,779



721
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:06,490
capital V and we can then save this file

722
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,490



723
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:08,769
alright now that we're done with that

724
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,769



725
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,420
you now need to start copying the

726
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,420



727
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:12,519
permissions you require and this is

728
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,519



729
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,160
unique for every application because as

730
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,160



731
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,100
you can see the Bitcoin wallet

732
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,100



733
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,810
application allows for these permissions

734
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,810



735
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,339
okay they allows the camera to be used

736
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,339



737
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,790
it allows a wakelock which is very very

738
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:21,790



739
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,269
good

740
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,269



741
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,860
a lot of Bluetooth NFC the network state

742
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,860



743
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,420
allows you to access the network state

744
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,420



745
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,820
so it has many of the important ones

746
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,820



747
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,060
that we have here so what we're going to

748
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,060



749
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:36,010
do is we are going to copy the important

750
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,010



751
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,399
ones and those are going to be are going

752
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,399



753
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,560
to do with the the course location the

754
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,560



755
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,079
file location the phone state send them

756
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,079



757
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,450
as SMS received as a mess record audio

758
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,450



759
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,700
call phone read contacts write contacts

760
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,700



761
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:52,390
record audio camera write external

762
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,390



763
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,100
storage we don't need the wallpaper

764
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,100



765
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,910
panel just get rid of it from there so

766
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,910



767
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:01,300
we'll copy these will copy the Android

768
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,300



769
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:04,000
permissions here and we will paste it in

770
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,000



771
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,450
and delete the duplicates from here so

772
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,450



773
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,700
again I will delete did the the

774
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,700



775
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,620
duplicates so let me just look for one

776
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,620



777
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,790
of them that I know we did have here

778
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,790



779
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,020
that was the wakelock

780
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,020



781
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:18,790
which I'm sure was up right over here

782
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,790



783
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,170
write call log set wallpaper we don't

784
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,170



785
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,680
need that one so let's get rid of that

786
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,680



787
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,660
first receive boot completed camera

788
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,660



789
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:32,350
settings right settings yeah that's fine

790
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:32,350



791
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:34,899
I believe I saw wake lock here but I

792
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,899



793
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,130
think yeah that should be it so yeah we

794
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,130



795
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,690
don't have any duplicates so that's

796
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,690



797
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,029
excellent so we're gonna save that

798
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,029



799
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,770
manifest file here and we are ready to

800
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,770



801
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,449
go we're ready to compile the

802
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,449



803
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,410
application so what we have done

804
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,410



805
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:46,180
essentially till

806
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,180



807
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,670
let me answer some questions before we

808
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,670



809
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:53,139
actually recompile so what we have done

810
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,139



811
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:56,170
till now is we have we have essentially

812
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:56,170



813
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,910
embedded the the MSF venom payload now

814
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,910



815
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,600
one thing to take into consideration is

816
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,600



817
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:03,879
we have not particularly obfuscated the

818
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,879



819
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,569
Android application which means there is

820
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:07,569



821
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,770
going to be some detection some level of

822
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,770



823
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,750
detection I'll probably be making

824
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,750



825
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,520
another video on this where I'll

826
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,520



827
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,010
actually show you how to perform the

828
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,010



829
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,270
obfuscation on a particular Android

830
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,270



831
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,970
application and your if you want to

832
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,970



833
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,260
perform obfuscation I believe I have one

834
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,260



835
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,110
of these links here that we used to use

836
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,110



837
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,150
before and that is apk wash apk wash

838
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,150



839
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,250
allows you to essentially obfuscate or

840
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,250



841
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,980
generate as you can see right over the

842
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,980



843
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,990
android apk antivirus evasion for MSF

844
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,990



845
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,230
venom generated payload so this allows

846
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,230



847
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:37,780
you to obfuscate various MSM MSF venom

848
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,780



849
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,179
payloads and of course I know that

850
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,179



851
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,450
embedding or injecting a payload with

852
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,450



853
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:44,740
MSF venom all already exists and yeah

854
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,740



855
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,600
someone is just pointed out that the

856
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,600



857
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,669
camera is a duplicate permission so let

858
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,669



859
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,460
me just check that out right now

860
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,460



861
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:53,700
looks like we have we also have read

862
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,700



863
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:58,059
context of those read and write contacts

864
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,059



865
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:00,309
let me check this right over here I can

866
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,309



867
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,720
see camera right here let's see if we

868
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,720



869
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,539
can find there we are thank you very

870
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,539



871
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,590
much for pointing that out

872
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,590



873
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,690
thanks for pointing that out really

874
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,690



875
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,970
appreciate that I was probably looking

876
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,970



877
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,700
for wakelock as well but it really

878
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,700



879
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,140
shouldn't cause an issue so let me just

880
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,140



881
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,880
save this right now and we can get

882
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,880



883
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,280
started with it with the recompilation

884
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,280



885
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,240
all right so we want to recompile the

886
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,240



887
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,850
original apk here and we can do that

888
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,850



889
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,530
right now so what we can do is we can

890
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,530



891
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,770
essentially recompile from any directory

892
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,770



893
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,720
so apk to and we'll say build and then

894
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,720



895
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,090
we can specify the directory again so

896
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,090



897
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,429
root desktop and then we specify the

898
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,429



899
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,110
original folder here now this is where

900
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,110



901
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,630
things get very very important when you

902
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,630



903
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,679
talk about using applications like the

904
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,679



905
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,539
or scripts like the fat rat for example

906
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,539



907
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,919
the fat rat is a tool that generates

908
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:50,919



909
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:54,669
most likely to - a - to great success a

910
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:54,669



911
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,140
signed payload apart from embedding

912
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,140



913
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,410
applications which we know is very very

914
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,410



915
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,600
difficult to do

916
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,600



917
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,270
matically because you usually get errors

918
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,270



919
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,500
so if you do get an error here if we do

920
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,500



921
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,750
get an error then I probably have to

922
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,750



923
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,040
take a deeper look at the application so

924
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,040



925
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,250
I'm just going to try and compile it

926
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,250



927
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,690
once to recompile it once if it doesn't

928
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,690



929
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,220
compile then I'll probably have to find

930
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,220



931
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,500
another application but I just wanted to

932
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,500



933
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,080
make a quick live stream for this video

934
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,080



935
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:22,130
so let me just answer a few questions

936
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,130



937
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,560
before we carry on use T mocks and I

938
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,560



939
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,060
wrote it under advice yes more hundred

940
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,060



941
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,410
videos are coming that's primarily why

942
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,410



943
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:32,360
I've started with this right now term ax

944
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,360



945
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:38,270
hacking excellent yes it is it's very

946
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:38,270



947
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:39,710
very good very good application yeah we

948
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,710



949
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,050
have a good question here telling us

950
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,050



951
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,360
I've tried the fat rat it failed with

952
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,360



953
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,550
signing yes that's probably because it

954
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,550



955
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,080
uses zipper line and I'm not sure if

956
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,080



957
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,450
we'll get an error right now we probably

958
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,450



959
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,210
will but let's see what error we get and

960
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,210



961
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,640
I'll probably try and and understand

962
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,640



963
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,170
what's going on now this is where real

964
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,170



965
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,050
skill comes into play because if you're

966
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,050



967
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,240
going to manually embed if you're going

968
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,240



969
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:04,280
to manually embed these these payloads

970
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,280



971
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,410
into applications it also gives you an

972
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,410



973
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,330
opportunity to test which applications

974
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,330



975
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,460
allow you to embed these various

976
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,460



977
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,560
payloads because some applications will

978
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,560



979
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,670
not recompile at all so it's very very

980
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,670



981
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,640
important to take that into

982
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,640



983
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:18,860
consideration so I've recently started

984
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,860



985
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,060
the recompilation process and this looks

986
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,060



987
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,280
like it's going to work and again it

988
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,280



989
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,830
tells us that it failed right over here

990
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,830



991
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,540
so let's take a look at what actually

992
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,540



993
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,520
caused the error and immediately we get

994
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,520



995
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:33,320
the a apt error which I'm not going to

996
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,320



997
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:41,420
explain what it is right now so if we

998
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:41,420



999
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:44,630
take so all right so if we take a look

1000
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,630



1001
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,500
at this right over here you can see that

1002
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,500



1003
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,420
by default

1004
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,420



1005
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,190
yes I'll be uploading the video after

1006
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,190



1007
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,600
you can see that we've got an error and

1008
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,600



1009
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,580
it's all is giving us an error in the

1010
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,580



1011
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,530
Android manifest file first but the main

1012
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,530



1013
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,070
issue is with the aapt which means we

1014
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,070



1015
00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:00,790
probably need the Android SDK installed

1016
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,790



1017
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,200
because of the various requirements so

1018
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,200



1019
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,730
what we can do is we can just try and

1020
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,730



1021
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,860
download another application here

1022
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,860



1023
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,440
probably a simpler application let me

1024
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,440



1025
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,850
just find one that's very

1026
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,850



1027
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,790
again very very simple I'll just let me

1028
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,790



1029
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,230
see if I can find another application

1030
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,230



1031
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,850
what if the main activity is hidden

1032
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,850



1033
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,080
there must be a main activity that's a

1034
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,080



1035
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,060
very very good question

1036
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,060



1037
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:27,070
in fact I'll just answer question I'll

1038
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:27,070



1039
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,330
make a separate video on this even if

1040
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,330



1041
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,220
the main activities yeah that's a very

1042
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,220



1043
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,470
good question so every application will

1044
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,470



1045
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,390
be designed differently and usually what

1046
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,390



1047
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,000
again what you're looking for is the

1048
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,000



1049
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,040
Android dot intent not main if you can

1050
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,040



1051
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,770
find those two lines where it actually

1052
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,770



1053
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,310
specifies the intent dot main and it

1054
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,310



1055
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,890
also specifies the icon or the drawable

1056
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,890



1057
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,830
icon if it's right over there then you

1058
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,830



1059
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,290
essentially know that the one of the the

1060
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,290



1061
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,570
the the top group right over there that

1062
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,570



1063
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,190
contains the the activity is going to be

1064
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,190



1065
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:02,410
the main activity so your job is to look

1066
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,410



1067
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,760
for that within these small E is to look

1068
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760



1069
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,380
with for that within the small e

1070
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,380



1071
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,980
compiler

1072
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,980



1073
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:11,080
alright so also the fat reduction yes

1074
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,080



1075
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,030
that's a very good question the fat rat

1076
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,030



1077
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,610
does not provide obfuscation it simply

1078
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,610



1079
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,680
signs the application so if I was to

1080
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,680



1081
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,620
compile this application I remember the

1082
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,620



1083
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,210
Google now launcher did work with the

1084
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,210



1085
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,580
recompilation so I'll do that for you

1086
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,580



1087
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,010
guys once more time or once again so

1088
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,010



1089
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,790
I'll download this here and I'll do it

1090
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,790



1091
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:33,580
again with you guys this this did work

1092
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,580



1093
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,650
what you will find is after I have

1094
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,650



1095
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,750
recompile the application I need to sign

1096
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,750



1097
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,460
it and that's where probably I can use

1098
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,460



1099
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,870
the fat rat or I'll actually be making a

1100
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,870



1101
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,690
separate video showing you how to do

1102
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,690



1103
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,340
this so I have downloaded the

1104
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,340



1105
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,250
application let me just wait for that to

1106
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,250



1107
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,590
complete let me see if that is a

1108
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,590



1109
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,000
downloading I probably yeah any well

1110
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,000



1111
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,460
I'll just wait for that to complete so

1112
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,460



1113
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,970
in the meantime what I'll do is I will

1114
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,970



1115
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,940
just go back to to my desktop here we'll

1116
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,940



1117
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:04,060
keep the payload I'll get rid of the the

1118
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,060



1119
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,940
Bitcoin wallet application here and I

1120
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,940



1121
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,010
will get rid of the original folder

1122
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,010



1123
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,660
which contained our our decompiled

1124
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,660



1125
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,410
application so we have the payload at

1126
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,410



1127
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,720
our APK here which we D compiled and if

1128
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,720



1129
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,250
we just list the files in here sorry for

1130
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,250



1131
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,780
that if we list the files we have the

1132
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,780



1133
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,370
payload folder which contains the

1134
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,370



1135
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,320
payload itself which is the most

1136
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,320



1137
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,350
important bit

1138
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,350



1139
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,620
we thought was once we start embedding

1140
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,620



1141
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,960
so again hopefully this just finishes

1142
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,960



1143
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,880
downloading for some reason it did not

1144
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,880



1145
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,529
start downloading apologies for that let

1146
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,529



1147
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,139
me just try and save my internet does

1148
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,139



1149
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:39,889
not seem to be working right now or has

1150
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:39,889



1151
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:43,200
it downloaded my browser is unresponsive

1152
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,200



1153
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:49,889
sadly so let me just read let me just

1154
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:49,889



1155
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:52,529
list let me just list my downloads

1156
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:52,529



1157
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:54,299
folder here looks like we do have the

1158
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,299



1159
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:57,330
the application has completed

1160
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:57,330



1161
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,519
downloading so if I can just check the

1162
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,519



1163
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,259
size of this looks like one of them is 8

1164
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,259



1165
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,559
megabytes yep so that looks like it's

1166
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:04,559



1167
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:11,220
completed so I'll just copy that um I'll

1168
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:11,220



1169
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:14,820
just copy the Downloads that let me just

1170
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,820



1171
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,230
get rid of that there and we'll just

1172
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,230



1173
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,970
copy the I will just copy the

1174
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,970



1175
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:22,460
application to the desktop and we can DD

1176
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,460



1177
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:25,169
compile that immediately alright so copy

1178
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,169



1179
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:29,279
the downloads and we'll copy the com

1180
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,279



1181
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:38,360
Android launcher desktop and on it enter

1182
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:38,360



1183
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:38,360
and for some reason looks like the files

1184
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:38,490



1185
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,269
[Applause]

1186
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,269



1187
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,470
looks like the Downloads did not

1188
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,470



1189
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:48,299
complete sorry root downloads keep keep

1190
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,299



1191
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,710
getting confused with that let me just

1192
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,710



1193
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,090
check the downloads it looks like they

1194
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,090



1195
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,659
haven't completed yet but for some

1196
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,659



1197
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,129
reason my my my browser isn't working

1198
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:56,129



1199
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,860
let's see if it does prompt us to

1200
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,860



1201
00:24:56,129 --> 00:25:01,259
actually download that in any case I'll

1202
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,259



1203
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,960
just copy I'll just delete the the

1204
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,960



1205
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,720
duplicate one right over here and

1206
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,720



1207
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,440
hopefully we can actually copy them now

1208
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,440



1209
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,440
so I'll just copy this

1210
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,070



1211
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,850
alright enough to speed through this

1212
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,850



1213
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:20,369
process now so that I can actually show

1214
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,369



1215
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,529
you that the compilation does work so

1216
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,529



1217
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:27,119
what we'll do now is we will use the

1218
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,119



1219
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:30,600
apktool apktool decompile and we'll come

1220
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,600



1221
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:36,929
go go right over here and we'll call

1222
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:36,929



1223

1295
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,119
files in there so it's

00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:27,859

payload file alright so now we can move

1300
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:30,080



1301
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,759

1302
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,759



1303
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,710
more to actually explore what's going on

1304
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:33,710



1305
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,450
so we'll go to the original Android

1306
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,450



1307
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,879
manifest file let me just close the

1308
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,879



1309
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,039
previous ones here because I don't want

1310
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:40,039



1311
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:41,509
to get confused with the other ones that

1312
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,509



1313
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:43,519
we had for the other application and

1314
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,519



1315
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:44,989
we'll get I will get rid of this as well

1316
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:44,989



1317
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,749
because we're not working with that

1318
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:49,749



1319
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:51,980
activity file so androidmanifest.xml and

1320
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,980



1321
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:54,259
now you can see with a simple

1322
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,259



1323
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,669
application again all we're looking for

1324
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:55,669

useful any useful permissions so we only

1422
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,990



1423
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:05,810
have read settings and write settings so

1424
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,810



1425
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,790
what I'll do is we can essentially just

1426
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,790



1427
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:10,160
copy everything so we do need internet

1428
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,160



1429
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:12,530
we need the Wi-Fi state we'll just copy

1430
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,530



1431
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,980
everything here we'll get real get rid

1432
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,980



1433
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:18,290
of the right settings option as well and

1434
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,290



1435
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,930
the we can also do that right here we

1436
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,930



1437
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,860
don't want to muck with the original

1438
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,860



1439
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:24,140
application permission otherwise that

1440
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,140



1441
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:28,150
can affect its functionality so again

1442
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,150



1443
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:31,730
we'll get rid of right settings here

1444
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,730



1445
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,860
I'll get rid of right settings and now

1446
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,860



1447
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,090
we can save this file and hopefully we

1448
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,090



1449
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,190
should be able to compile this

1450
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,190



1451
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,870
application now without any errors as

1452
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,870



1453
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,760
far as I remember this was the only one

1454
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,760



1455
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:44,110
working so again before we do that let

1456
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,110



1457
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,110
me just try and answer some questions

1458
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,060



1459
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:52,790
harsh

1460
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,790



1461
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,650
de nani I love the videos I'm a commerce

1462
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,650



1463
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,660
students a practice that's excellent

1464
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,660



1465
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,400
that's primarily why these videos are

1466
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,400



1467
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,860
there so go ahead just enjoy practicing

1468
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,860



1469
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,590
that's what it's all about so again

1470
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,590



1471
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:07,010
we'll use the apk tool and we will build

1472
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,010



1473
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,080
so build a root desktop and we'll use

1474
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,080



1475
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:12,560
the original folder in it and hopefully

1476
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,560



1477
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,420
now the application there we are the

1478
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,420



1479
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,250
application was successfully compiled we

1480
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,250



1481
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,320
did get the a apt error but that was

1482
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,320



1483
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,050
very very a very very small error and if

1484
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,050



1485
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,710
we just take a look at the sorry if we

1486
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,710



1487
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:26,330
just take a look at the we just list the

1488
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,330



1489
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,970
files here sorry let me just list the

1490
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,970



1491
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,970
files you can see that under the dist

1492
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,970



1493
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:34,280
folder under the dist folder we have the

1494
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,280



1495
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,930
compiled application here and now that

1496
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,930



1497
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,550
is not signed that is something to take

1498
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,550



1499
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:40,580
into consideration but we have

1500
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,580



1501
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:43,130
successfully embedded the payload within

1502
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,130



1503
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,810
the Android application so now that we

1504
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,810



1505
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,740
have embedded it whenever we launch this

1506
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,740



1507
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:50,410
application and because it is a launcher

1508
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,410



1509
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,360
certainly be active and whenever the

1510
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,360



1511
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,820
main activity is triggered we will get

1512
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,820



1513
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,860
our payload session now the other videos

1514
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,860



1515
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,870
that I want to make is we need to

1516
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,870



1517
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,700
obfuscate well we need to focus on

1518
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,700



1519
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,500
obfuscation because that is primarily

1520
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,500



1521
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,330
going to be how you get the application

1522
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,330



1523
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,010
on a particular device and then the

1524
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,010



1525
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,360
other one is persistence through either

1526
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,360



1527
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,390
creating a script and of course that's

1528
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,390



1529
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,309
going to depend on on on creating a

1530
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,309



1531
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,900
persistent script and essentially

1532
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,900



1533
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,670
getting the application to run and then

1534
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,670



1535
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,920
finally the video i'll be making last is

1536
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,920



1537
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,770
how to hide the application from the

1538
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,770



1539
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,240
application draw alright so that's

1540
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,240



1541
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,550
pretty much what i'm going to be

1542
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,550



1543
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,130
covering for this livestream i know you

1544
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,130



1545
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,170
guys wanted me to cover quite a bit more

1546
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,170



1547
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,370
but there that's all I have time for and

1548
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,370



1549
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,290
I'll be making the other videos

1550
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,290



1551
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,090
following up so my next video on Android

1552
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,090



1553
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,370
will be signing the application then

1554
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,370



1555
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,470
making it a fully undetectable as best

1556
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,470



1557
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,960
as possible but for those of you who are

1558
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,960



1559
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:45,340
curious you can also use the backwash

1560
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,340



1561
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,920
apk the backwash script so yeah I don't

1562
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,920



1563
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,580
Mike telling me to change my ISP yes I

1564
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,580



1565
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,580
am working on that

1566
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,320



1567
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,309
thanks bro for this video yes this video

1568
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,309



1569
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,020
will be available off to the stream can

1570
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,020



1571
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,480
we do it to any apps above ten megabytes

1572
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,480



1573
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,220
yes you can do it most of the

1574
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,220



1575
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,800
applications but again it's all about

1576
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,800



1577
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,230
how the application was developed if the

1578
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,230



1579
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,309
application was developed differently

1580
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,309



1581
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:14,530
then in the sense that they have various

1582
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,530



1583
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:16,600
renaming for the activities for the main

1584
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,600



1585
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:23,710
activities then you pretty much will be

1586
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:23,710



1587
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:25,960
will have some errors we have a message

1588
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,960



1589
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,670
from photo /a know it on the state in

1590
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,670



1591
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,530
action you'll see it in action in the

1592
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,530



1593
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:31,630
next video I'll use the exact same

1594
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,630



1595
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,980
application and I'll show you what

1596
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,980



1597
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,900
happens when you try and install it

1598
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,900



1599
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,120
directly on the latest version of

1600
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,120



1601
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,550
Android which is Android 9 what will

1602
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,550



1603
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,170
happen on Android 9 is it'll actually

1604
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,170



1605
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,090
warn you that the application is

1606
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,090



1607
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,980
malicious and that's primarily because

1608
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,980



1609
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:48,880
we're using the reverse TCP payload if

1610
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,880



1611
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:52,030
we were using the reverse HTTP or HTTPS

1612
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,030



1613
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,420
and we with port 443 than that should

1614
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,420



1615
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:57,880
should potentially avoid detection but

1616
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,880



1617
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,130
again obvious question will be quite

1618
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,130



1619
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,480
important alright so I'll answer few

1620
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,480



1621
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,210

really appreciate you guys watching the

1626
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:10,750

stream are you from Kenya yes I am in

1628
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,369



1629
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,369
Kenya majority of the time for work

1630
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:22,480



1631
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:28,890
let's see how do I feel about the use of

1632
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,890



1633
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,630
ATP shell ADB is very very powerful I'm

1634
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,630



1635
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:33,000
guessing you're talking about forensics

1636
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,000



1637
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:43,200

1638
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:43,200

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:45,150
give me a bit more information no more

1640
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,150



1641
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,830
questions you can use the hackers ploy

1642
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,830



1643
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:53,910
tag so I can see your message a bit more

1644
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:53,910



1645
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:55,770
clearly yes I've heard of West parklands

1646
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,770



1647
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:58,550
I'm not sure where sparklings but I know

1648
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,550



1649
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,550
about parklands

1650
00:34:59,530 --> 00:34:59,530



1651
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:06,570

1659
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,930
guessing you're talking about social

1660
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,930



1661
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:20,550

well I'm a penetration tester so I have

1664
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,900

1673
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,790
making a video on that that is a very

1674
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,790



1675
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,010
again very tricky and it does involve a

1676
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,010



1677
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,560
bit of manual work so the scripts really

1678
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,560

1928
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:30,990



1929
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,520

1930
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,520



1931
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:37,800

00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,220

Science in information systems that's a

1986
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,240



1987
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,650

1993
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,150
I would recommend taking the Network+

1994
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,150



1995
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,770

00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,569



2001
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:21,359
you go into anything like osep I

2002
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,359



2003
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:26,799
definitely recommend going for OS CP

2004
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:26,799



2005
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,329
security plus and pen test plus as well

00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,329

2008
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,200

00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:52,329
videos have I got paid for any bugs yes

2022
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:52,329



2023
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,450
I've got paid for three bugs in my

2024
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,450



2025
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:58,180
lifetime I think the total to about

2026
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,180



2027
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:00,339
maybe $800 so not really any big bugs

2028
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,339



2029
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,069
particularly but again it's just that I

2030
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:03,069



2031
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:06,480
don't have the time for bug bounty work

2032
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:06,480



2033
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:06,480
but when I do I usually try it out

2034
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,070



2035
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:30,220
greetings to Ukraine with master got it

2036
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,220



2037
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,520
correct many of the issues with port

2038
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,520



2039
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:35,940
folding are because of nut-nut

2040
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,940



2041
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,800
configurations and if your ISP if is

2042
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,800



2043
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:41,710
particularly doing it a connected

2044
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,710



2045
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:47,560
Internet to your entire building that is

2046
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:47,560



2047
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:49,570
a common syndrome what's the best way to

2048
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,570



2049
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,310
get your payloads undetectable by

2050
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,310



2051
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,200
Windows Defender well I've been working

2052
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,200



2053
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,090
or I've been taking a look at one of

2054
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,090



2055
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,280
these scripts here I don't know if I can

2056
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,280



2057
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,840
just show you this house planning to

2058
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,840



2059
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,750
make a video on it it is the Phantom

2060
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,750



2061
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:05,200
evasion tool phantom evasion tool allows

2062
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,200



2063
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:07,540
you here if I can just launch it let me

2064
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,540



2065
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,200
let me just launch it Python phantom

2066
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,200



2067
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:14,950
evasion dot pie so let me just start

2068
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,950



2069
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,130
this up here phantom evasion allows you

2070
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,130



2071
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:19,540
to generate various stages here so I'll

2072
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,540



2073
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,630
show you this right now so you have your

2074
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,630



2075
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,660
C meterpreter stage I'll get to that so

2076
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,660



2077
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,010
you in your Windows modules you have

2078
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,010



2079
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,660
your shell code injection you have your

2080
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,660



2081
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,400
stages so if you're looking for stages

2082
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,400



2083
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,990
which I'm guessing you are you can find

2084
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,990



2085
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,870
them right over here so if you and your

2086
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,870



2087
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:37,630
64-bit stages you have your reverse TCP

2088
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,630



2089
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:41,370
virtual lock which works great if you

2090
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,370



2091
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:44,500
are looking particularly to do sort of

2092
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,500



2093
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:45,340
to essentially prevent detection by

2094
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,340



2095
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,990
Windows Defender

2096
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,990



2097
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,680
I would recommend this stage your

2098
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,680



2099
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,680
modules here

2100
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:56,770



2101
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,000
what is my opinion about island security

2102
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,000



2103
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:03,920
I haven't I haven't consumed any of

2104
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,920



2105
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,540
their courses yet but I'll definitely

2106
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,540



2107
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,810
try them out they look like they have

2108
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:11,810



2109
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:13,850
very very good courses how do you let

2110
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,850



2111
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,720
the terminal continue suggestions I

2112
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,720



2113
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:17,270
think you're talking about

2114
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,270



2115
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,940
auto-completion that is the tab based on

2116
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,940



2117
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:21,470
the current file structure or whether or

2118
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,470



2119
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,570
not you have the file in that particular

2120
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,570



2121
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,520
directory so just use your tab key and

2122
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,520



2123
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:31,610
that should autocomplete for you to the

2124
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:31,610



2125
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:34,310
nearest approximation yes you can and I

2126
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,310



2127
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:36,620
do recommend using reverse HTTP are on

2128
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,620



2129
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:41,780
Android because you can actually make it

2130
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,780



2131
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:43,970
you can make it sort of undetectable by

2132
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,970



2133
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,230
by essentially monitoring the traffic

2134
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,230



2135
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,880
coming from the application because

2136
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,880



2137
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:50,110
everything will be going to and from

2138
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:50,110



2139
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,110
port 443

2140
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,260



2141
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:07,190
grim hues good day from Australia same

2142
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,190

00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,600



2145
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:13,580
there how to start model analysis that's

2146
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,580



2147
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,800
a good question a lot of things to cover

2148
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,800



2149
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:19,480
I'll probably have to make an

2150
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:19,480



2151
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,480
introduction video to that as well cause

2152
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,160



2153
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:27,080
Rakesh Sharma asks me are the courses by

2154
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,080



2155
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,850

definitely Australia

2176
00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:04,339



2177
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:09,570
Eric risk oh I like your recent collab

2178
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,570



2179
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:12,330
with IT career questions yes I just made

2180
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,330



2181
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,680
the video yesterday very very good

2182
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,680



2183
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:17,730
questions you can check that out as well

2184
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:17,730



2185
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:28,619
I have about one minute left to ask your

2186
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:28,619



2187
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:31,230
questions so go ahead and shoot you know

2188
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:31,230



2189
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:33,030
any rapped with eternal blue exploit I'm

2190
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,030



2191
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,730
not sure what you mean by that remote

2192
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,730



2193
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:37,530
access tool usually as the payload and

2194
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,530



2195
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,060
then which you install on the client and

2196
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,060



2197
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,900
then you have the server sitting on the

2198
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:39,900



2199
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,180
server really

2200
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,180



2201
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,710
so I'm guessing you're talking about the

2202
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,710



2203
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,570
exploit the actual exploit is getting

2204
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,570



2205
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,970
the payload installed so you can

2206
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,970



2207
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,040
consider the eternal blue exploit a form

2208
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,040



2209
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,330
of a remote access tool however remote

2210
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,330



2211
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:57,030
access tool does give you more

2212
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:57,030



2213
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:58,740
functionality a wife a dentist yes I

2214
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,740



2215
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,930
have videos on that you can check out my

2216
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,930



2217
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:04,160
the playlists I have the wpa2

2218
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,160



2219
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,160

although India is a pretty cool place

2232
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,510

looks like a really interesting place

2236
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,210



2237
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,210
culturally

2238
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:53,930



2239
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,440
to iron from YouTube yes the the channel

2240
00:50:56,779 --> 00:50:58,440



2241
00:50:56,789 --> 00:51:00,210
is monetized to a certain extent but

2242
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,210



2243
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,470
again because of the limitations in

2244
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,470



2245
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:03,750
regards to the videos that I can't

00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,750

00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:05,789
monetize I don't earn a lotta really

2248
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,789



2249
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:09,660
just goes into the hosting and stuff

2250
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:09,660

00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:06,830
bug it was remote code execution I

2280
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,830



2281
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:10,250

2289
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:37,030
three years now the the exploit

2290
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,030

2295
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:44,310
sadly because of the content that it has

2296
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,310



2297
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:49,090

00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,180
interested in it and then get the OU SCP

2304
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,180



2305
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,390
you have security plus that's pretty

2306
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,390



2307
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,390

2308
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560



2309
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:13,580

2310
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,580



2311
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:18,260
have a dedicated setup but I do have an

2312
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:18,260



2313
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:20,120
environment that I do create with I do

2314
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,120



2315
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,590
have a collection of tools that I do use

2316
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,590



2317
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,420
constantly so I'll probably make a video

2318
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,420



2319
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:32,660

2327
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:50,150
yeah I think I'll pretty much end the

2328
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,150
